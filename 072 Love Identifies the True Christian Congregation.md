# Love Identifies the True Christian Congregation
Song 105

North - Lewisville Congregation 

## INTRODUCTION (3')
### Identity theft
> The young woman started getting nasty messages on her answering machine from several men. Then a man reached her by phone and said that he was responding to the indecent invitations she had posted on the Internet. But she did not even own a computer. It took her a while to find out that someone had assumed her identity in cyberspace and was posting the ads on the Internet. Not only that, but the shadowy impostor was giving out her address, directions to her residence, and even advice on how to bypass her house alarm!  

- Had become victim of increasing trend of identity theft
- Account published in 2001
    - Since then trend has only gotten worse

### Many of us take identity for granted
- We are who we are
    - When challenged, we can prove it
- What about a Christian’s identity?
    - Some who claim to be Christian may identify with symbols
        - Cross, fish
        - White collar, shaved head
        - Perhaps a sign in front of their house
    - Others may do many works in the name of Jesus Christ
        - Missionaries
        - Build homes, hospitals
        - Even preach door-to-door!
            - None of these is what Jesus said would identify his followers

### What should identify true Christians today?
- Answer found at John 13:34,35

## WHY LOVE IS THE FOREMOST IDENTIFYING MARK OF TRUE CHRISTIANS (7')
### What is this love?
- phi•li´a: tender affection b/w friends based on emotion
- stor•ge´: natural affection b/w relatives
    - At least, it should be! 
        - Because of world conditions today, not everyone has this 
- e´ros: romantic attraction b/w sexes (not mentioned in G.S.)
    - The type of love the world focuses on
- a•ga´pe: guided by principle; may include fondness/affection
    - Not unfeeling; however, not ruled by sentiment
    - Never ignores Jehovah’s principles
    - Referred to most in scripture
        - Word used to describe love Christ shows cong.

### Love among true Christians is unique
- Not simply an emotion that wells up in our hearts
- Bond that unites Christians is combination of
    - Family love (spiritual family)
    - Affection for true friends
    - BUT with all relationships governed by love based on Bible principles
- This love is markedly different than the love common in the world

### Love greater than gifts of spirit, faith and hope 
`1 Cor. 13:13`
- Efforts to acquire knowledge/grow in faith could be selfish vs. 2
    - Would bring no benefit from God
- Jesus said many would prophesy, expel demons, perform powerful works
- Even hope can be self-centered

### Power of love; sums up the entire law 
`Ro. 13:9,10`
- Because of this, may expect too much
    - CC made from people of all nations, languages, races, cultures
    - Can use imperfections as a cause for stumbling

### Love of true Christian brotherhood has no equal in human society
- Just as a magnet draws iron to itself, love draws Christians together
    - And attracts sincere ones to true worship

### We must learn to apply in response to daily situations/problems
- Helps to look at 1st century cong. as a guide

## FIRST CENTURY CHRISTIANS WERE NOT PERFECT, BUT THEY SHOWED LOVE (12')
### Imperfections evident, even among apostles
- Jealousy, ambition, lack of humility showed on number of occasions `Mr. 9:33-35`
    - Why did they act that way?
        - By inheritance, humans inclined to think more of themselves than they should
        - World cultivates sense of superiority, getting ahead of others
            - Disciples raised as Jews; stressed position/rank in all dealings
    - No surprise at times imperfect humans seek position & prestige
        - They are predisposed
        - Can happen now just as in 1st century

### Peter, though prominent, had to be corrected several times

- Some instances:
    - Rebuked by Jesus for wrongfully-motivated thinking `Mt. 16:21-23`
    - Boasted of superior faith/standing before other apostles `Mt. 26:31-34`
    - Denied Jesus 3 times `Mt. 26:69-75`
    - Gave in to fear of man; was reproved by Paul `Gal. 2:11-14`
    - Raised as a Jew, taught to look down on other races
        - Peter had made much progress in this a few years earlier
        - He had spread good news to Gentiles, but evidently needed more refinement

- In spite of this, what happened?
    - Jesus continued to use Peter prominently
    - Jesus saw past Peter’s imperfections
    - Peter’s deep love & other qualities  outweighed imperfections
        - He wrote: “Love one another intensely from the heart” at 1 Pe. 1:22
    - In later accounts he no longer took the first place among his brothers
        - Strong evidence Jesus’ lessons took hold
    - Did Peter stop talking to Paul because he corrected him?
        - No, the Bible record shows that they continued to serve as brothers

### Paul, though exemplary in love and devotion, had imperfections
- Paul & Barnabas, prominent elders, allowed tempers to flare over small matter `Ac. 15:36-39`
    - They were both known for being warmhearted and tender men
        - Still, imperfect human tendencies got the better of them
- Paul had questions about Mark's dependability 
    - `vs. 37`: Barnabas "was determined" to take Mark
        - Barnabas may have been influenced by family ties
        - Should have yielded to Paul as an apostle chosen to spread the good news 
- They demonstrated they had “love among [themselves]”
    - Did not involve other elders or the governing body in their dispute
    - Paul did not hold a grudge against Mark for his failings
        - He later wrote to Timothy that he found Mark helpful in the ministry
        - His writing to the Colossians indicates that Mark was with him once again in a theocratic assignment
    - Mark did not begrudge Paul for rebuking him
        - He clearly worked to apply Paul’s words and proved his dependability in the future
        - Mark could have been stumbled by what he witnessed
            - Perhaps Paul even accused Barnabas of nepotism during the dispute, in front of Mark
            - He was not stumbled and was rewarded with many privileges
                - Enjoyed close relationship with Peter
                - Inspired by Jehovah to write gospel account
    - How would we have been affected by these mistakes?
        - Would I have been stumbled? Would you?
            - Or would we have forgiven them in love?
- Love will help us to overcome imperfections of the elders, traveling overseers, and anyone else in the organization

## CHRISTIAN LOVE COVERS IMPERFECTIONS (5')
### True Christians imitate their creator in love for mankind 
`Ro 5:8` (keep open)
- They do not wait for fellow Christians to be perfect before showing love

### Must have balanced view of relationship with each other
- B/c of inherited imperfection, all inclined to do wrong `Ro. 5:12`
    - Tendency to become envious, provoked, to brag, be unforgiving, etc.
    - Sinful inclinations will find expression among true Christians
- We are also prone to extremes in viewpoint
    - The more balanced our viewpoints, the fewer conflicts we will have with fellow believers
        - Don’t want to be self-righteous, condemning all who don’t meet our standards
        - Or overly tolerant and permissive, not loving w/view to Jh’s standards (not agape)
    - Those things need not drive wedge between us
        - God’s spirit can help us with oversensitivity
            - So that we aren’t easily offended

### Paul's description of love shows we can deal with each other in recognition of imperfections 
`1 Co. 13:4,5`
- Love is patient and kind
    - Patient: able to accept or tolerate problems or suffering without becoming annoyed or anxious
    - Gladly puts up with idiosyncrasies & differing opinions
        - Does this with a view to helping others gain salvation
- Does not become provoked
    - Does not look for an excuse to become provoked
    - Not easily offended by what others do or say
        - “The taking of offense lodges in the bosom of fools” (Ec. 7:9)
- Does not keep account of the injury
    - Yes, there will be injury; be ready to show love!
    - Unloving to harbor grudges or dwell on (perceived) injustices
        - Intense love helps us to cover over mistakes made by overseers
            - Heb. 13:17 encourages obedience, even though they are imperfect

## FOLLOW THE WAY OF LOVE DESPITE IMPERFECTIONS (2')
### True cong. no longer identified by gifts of spirit
- Now by love the “never fails” according to 1 Co. 13:8

### We must remember Peter's inspired counsel
`1 Pe. 4:8`
- Though not condoning wrongdoing, be quick to show love that “covers a multitude of sins”

## CONCLUSION
### We discussed:
- Love is the identifying mark of true Christianity
- Why love identifies Christians
- 1st century Christians not perfect, but they showed love
    - Jesus set example in his dealings with disciples
- How Christian love covers imperfections

### Resolve to apply love liberally any way we can
- Do not allow causes for stumbling
- Let us not keep a running tab of injuries!

### Just as the woman we discussed at the beginning, identity thieves are all around us
- Many today claim to be Christian

### By doing these things we prove to everyone that we are Christ's followers because
    - Love identifies the true Christian congregation!
